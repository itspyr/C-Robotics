**Embedded Systems and Robotics in C++**

This repository is a collection of embedded systems and robotics projects built with C++ and Arduino microcontrollers. Each experiment explores how code interacts with real-world hardware — from basic LED control and timing to complex sensor integration, motion systems, and autonomous behaviors.

**What’s Inside**

Control logic for LEDs, sensors, and actuators

Experiments in digital and analog I/O

Seven-segment display control and timing loops

Early robotics projects using motors, ultrasonic sensors, and servos

Structured and modular C++ code for microcontroller environments

**Technologies & Tools**

Language: C++ (Arduino framework)

Platform: Arduino Uno / Nano

Concepts: Control structures, functions, arrays, logic timing, pulse-width modulation, and embedded design fundamentals

**Purpose**

This work serves as a foundation for robotics and embedded systems engineering, combining software logic with electronic hardware to develop reactive, data-driven systems. It reflects experimentation, learning, and applied understanding of how microcontrollers bring algorithms to life in physical form.

**Vision**

The goal is to grow from basic signal control to autonomous robotics, integrating sensors, decision-making algorithms, and communication between devices — all built step-by-step through C++ experimentation and creative problem-solving.
